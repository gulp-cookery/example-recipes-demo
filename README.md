# example-recipes-demo

Taking examples from [gulp-cheatsheet](https://github.com/osscafe/gulp-cheatsheet), demonstrates what [gulp-chef](https://github.com/gulp-cookery/gulp-chef) can achieve.

However, this is to demonstrate what gulp-chef can achieve, not encourage you write configuration this way.

## How to Run

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/gulp-cookery/example-recipes-demo.git
$ cd example-recipes-demo
$ npm install
$ gulp
```
